## ☆ About Me

My name is Hanna, and I'm currently a second-year student pursuing a Bachelors of Data Science at The University of Auckland. This repository has been created for my *Data Technologies* course, as a part of a project to get familiar with using GitHub and Markdown :) 

Since you're here, I'll do a little intro of what I'm passionate about!

### **My favourite things include:**

- 🎨 Art and design, be it traditional, digital, or UI/UX design! One of my favourite artists is [Claude Monet](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cmon/hd_cmon.htm), so this page is decorated with some of his work ✿
- 🪶 Poetry! I especially love the creativity of free-form poetry, such as the writing by [e. e. cummings](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/e-e-cummings)!
- 🌎 And of course, data! Data is the core of people and our community, and our weapon for development and innovation. I'm especially interested in combining this with my interests in design communication by applying it to [data visualisation](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization#:~:text=Data%20visualization%20is%20the%20graphical,outliers%2C%20and%20patterns%20in%20data.) :)

## ☆ Just for Fun

### Here are some space fun facts? 

Source: Me, an astrophysics expert (I took a beginners Astronomy course last year)

1. Our Moon is lemon-shaped 🌙
2. The sun accounts for 99.86% of the total mass in our solar system, even including all of our planets, moons, asteroids, comets and everything else combined! 🪐
3. The centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, smells like raspberries 🌷
4. While all the other planets orbit the Sun in a counter-clockwise direction, Venus rotates clockwise while Uranus literally rolls on its side 💫
5. If our universe had the same lifespan as a human, life (us😨) arose so quickly that it would only be 3 days old! 🌿
