## â˜† About Me

My name is Hanna, and I'm currently a second-year student pursuing a Bachelors of Data Science at The University of Auckland. This repository has been created for my *Data Technologies* course, as part of a project to get familiar with using GitHub and Markdown :) Since you're here, I'll do a little introduction of myself!

#### **My favourite things include:**

- ðŸŽ¨ Art and design, be it traditional, digital, or UI/UX design! One of my favourites is [Claude Monet](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cmon/hd_cmon.htm), so this page is decorated with some of his work
- ðŸª¶ Poetry! I especially love the creativity of free-form poetry, such as those by [e. e. cummings](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/e-e-cummings)!
- ðŸŒŽ And of course, data! Data is the core of people and our community, and our weapon for development and innovation. I'm especially interested in combining this with my interests in design and communication by applying it to data visualisation :)
